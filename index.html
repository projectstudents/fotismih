      <h1 class="about"> What do we do as Web Developers</h1>
      <p class="description"> 
        A web developer makes and maintains websites. They are in charge of a site’s overall look and feel. Web developers also handle the technical aspects of a website, including its performance (website speed) and capacity (the maximum amount of traffic the site could handle at a given time). A web developer is usually knowledgeable in both graphic design and programming.

        Web developers deal with different kinds of websites, including e-commerce, gaming, and news sites. These different website types have certain requirements. For instance, a gaming website must deftly handle advanced graphics. Ecommerce sites, on the other hand, would require the integration of a payment-processing feature and the capacity to deal with stock coming in and out. A web developer decides a site’s applications and designs accordingly.
